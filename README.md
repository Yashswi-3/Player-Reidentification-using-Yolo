# Player Re-identification in Sports Footage

A sophisticated computer vision system for tracking and re-identifying players in sports footage using YOLOv11 object detection and advanced tracking algorithms.

## 🎯 Project Overview

This project implements **Option 2: Re-identification in Single Feed** from the Liat.ai assignment. The system processes a 15-second sports video to maintain consistent player IDs even when players temporarily leave and re-enter the frame, demonstrating advanced tracking-by-detection capabilities with persistent memory for true re-identification.

## ✨ Key Features

- **🔍 Advanced Object Detection**: Fine-tuned YOLOv11 model for accurate player/goalkeeper detection
- **🧠 Persistent Re-identification**: Memory system maintains player IDs throughout entire video duration
- **⚡ Real-time Processing**: 7-15 FPS performance on modern GPUs
- **🎨 Multi-modal Features**: Combines visual appearance, color histograms, and spatial cues
- **🔄 Hungarian Algorithm**: Optimal detection-to-track assignment for maximum accuracy
- **📊 Comprehensive Analytics**: Detailed tracking statistics and performance metrics

    video_path="data/15sec_input_720p.mp4",
    conf_thres=0.6,
    iou_thres=0.5
)

tracker.run(save_output=True, output_path="custom_output.mp4")

### Performance Testing
Disable visualization for maximum speed  
Comment out `cv2.imshow()` line in `run()` method

## 📊 Expected Results

### Performance Metrics
- **Processing Speed**: 7-15 FPS (GPU), 2-5 FPS (CPU)
- **Detection Rate**: 12-18 players per frame
- **Re-identification Accuracy**: 85%+ for temporary disappearances
- **ID Stability**: Near-zero flickering during continuous visibility

### Output Files
- **Video Output**: Annotated video with player IDs and bounding boxes
- **Statistics**: JSON file with comprehensive tracking metrics
- **Console Logs**: Real-time progress and performance information

## 🔧 Technical Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Object Detection**: YOLOv11 model detects players, goalkeepers, referees, and ball
2. **Feature Extraction**: Multi-modal features combining:
   - Deep visual features (ResNet18) - 60% weight
   - Color histograms (HSV) - 30% weight  
   - Spatial features (position/size) - 10% weight
3. **Track Management**: Hungarian algorithm for optimal assignment
4. **Re-identification**: Persistent memory system for disappeared players

### Key Algorithms

- **Temporal Feature Smoothing**: Exponential moving average (α=0.7)
- **Motion Prediction**: Constant velocity model with spatial gates
- **Hungarian Assignment**: Optimal detection-to-track matching
- **Outlier Rejection**: Filters unreliable features (similarity < 0.3)

## 🎨 Visualization

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**1. CUDA not available**  
Install PyTorch with CUDA support  
pip install torch torchvision --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118

**2. Model loading errors**  
Ensure ultralytics is installed  
pip install ultralytics

**3. Video file not found**  
Check file paths and ensure video exists  
ls data/15sec_input_720p.mp4

**4. Low performance**  
- Ensure GPU drivers are updated  
- Close other GPU-intensive applications  
- Consider reducing video resolution

### Debug Mode

Enable detailed logging by modifying detection methods:  
Add debug prints in `detect_players()` method  
`print(f"Frame {frame_count}: {len(detections)} detections")`

## 📈 Performance Optimization

### GPU Optimization
- **Driver Updates**: Ensure latest NVIDIA drivers
- **Memory Management**: Close unnecessary applications
- **Batch Processing**: Process multiple frames simultaneously

### CPU Optimization
- **Reduce Resolution**: Process at 640x360 instead of 1280x720
- **Disable Visualization**: Comment out `cv2.imshow()` for faster processing
- **Feature Simplification**: Use dummy features instead of deep extraction
