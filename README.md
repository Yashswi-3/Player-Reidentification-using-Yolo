# Player Re-Identification in Sports Footage

A robust, real-time computer vision system for tracking and re-identifying players in sports videos using YOLOv11 (Ultralytics) and advanced ID-stable tracking-by-detection techniques.

## Project Overview

This project solves **Option 2: Re-identification in Single Feed** from the Liat.ai challenge. The system maintains consistent player IDs in a 15-second sports clip — even after temporary disappearances — using memory, deep visual embeddings, and robust assignment logic.

## Key Features

- **YOLOv11 Detection (Ultralytics):** Real-time player, goalkeeper, and ball detection.
- **Persistent Re-Identification:** Tracks players across occlusions using memory and re-ID logic.
- **ResNet18 Embeddings:** Deep features extracted with pre-trained ResNet18 for identity modeling.
- **Multi-Modal Fusion:** Appearance, color histogram, and spatial features fused with learned weights.
- **Enhanced Hungarian Matching:** Optimal detection-to-track assignment with secondary verification.
- **Temporal Smoothing:** Exponential moving average (α=0.7) reduces identity flicker.
- **Motion Prediction:** Constant velocity model with gating logic to prevent false matches.
- **Detailed Tracking Statistics:** Re-ID counts, ID switches, and memory behavior logged.
- **Visualization:** Bounding boxes, ID labels, motion arrows, re-ID color coding.

## Technical Architecture

### Core Modules

1. **Detection**: YOLOv11 via `ultralytics` with confidence & class filters.
2. **Feature Extraction**: ResNet18 deep embeddings, color histograms, spatial features.
3. **Track Matching**: Hungarian algorithm with distance, IoU, and cosine similarity.
4. **Re-Identification**: Memory bank with appearance-matching and velocity-aware logic.
5. **Visualization**: Live drawing of boxes, IDs, arrows, stats overlay.

### Algorithms Used

- Cosine similarity for features
- Exponential Moving Average (EMA)
- Constant velocity motion model
- Linear Sum Assignment (Hungarian)
- Re-ID fallback using appearance-only match

## Visualization Legend

- **Green Box**: Active track
- **Blue Box**: Re-identified player
- **Arrows**: Motion direction
- **Overlay Text**: Frame count, active/memory/re-ID counts

## Troubleshooting

| Issue                        | Solution                                              |
|-----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| `Cannot open video`         | Verify `data/15sec_input_720p.mp4` exists             |
| `Model not loading`         | Ensure YOLOv11 weights (`best.pt`) are valid          |
| Slow CPU inference          | Reduce resolution or disable `cv2.imshow()`           |
| No detections               | Check `conf_thres` and class names in YOLO            |
| Errors in feature extraction | Ensure `torchvision` is installed correctly           |

## Optimization Tips

- Use GPU with CUDA-enabled PyTorch for 3x+ faster tracking.
- Disable visualization (`cv2.imshow`) for speed benchmarking.
- Reduce frame size for low-end hardware.
- Track only specific classes (e.g., `player`, `goalkeeper`) to reduce overhead.

## Compliance with Assignment

- ✅ Single camera input only
- ✅ YOLOv11 used for all detections
- ✅ Modular and real-time (frame-wise) system
- ✅ Re-ID recovery with memory logic
- ✅ Accurate stats and no hardcoded assumptions
