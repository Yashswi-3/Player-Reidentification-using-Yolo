# Player Re-identification in Sports Footage: A Multi-Modal Tracking Approach

## Abstract

This paper presents a sophisticated computer vision system for player re-identification in sports footage using advanced tracking-by-detection algorithms. Our approach combines YOLOv11 object detection with multi-modal feature fusion (visual, color, spatial) and implements Hungarian algorithm optimization with temporal feature smoothing to achieve persistent player tracking. The system successfully maintains consistent player IDs throughout a 15-second video, achieving zero ID flickering during continuous visibility and 85%+ re-identification accuracy for temporarily disappeared players, while processing at 7-15 FPS on modern GPUs.

## 1. Introduction

### Problem Motivation
Player tracking and re-identification in sports footage presents significant challenges due to rapid movements, occlusions, similar appearances, and camera motion. Traditional tracking methods suffer from ID switching and inability to re-identify players after temporary disappearances, limiting their applicability in professional sports analytics.

### Research Significance
Robust player re-identification enables advanced sports analytics including tactical analysis, performance metrics, and automated highlight generation. The ability to maintain consistent player identities throughout match footage is crucial for professional sports broadcasting and coaching applications.

### Technical Contribution
We propose a novel multi-modal tracking system that combines:
1. **Temporal feature smoothing** to eliminate ID flickering  
2. **Persistent memory architecture** for true re-identification  
3. **Motion-aware Hungarian assignment** for optimal track matching  
4. **Multi-crop feature extraction** for robust appearance modeling

### Related Work
- **Traditional Tracking**: Kalman filter-based approaches suffer from appearance changes and occlusions.  
- **Deep Learning Tracking**: SORT/DeepSORT methods lack persistent re-identification capabilities.  
- **Sports-Specific Tracking**: Recent work focuses on team sports but doesn't address long-term re-identification requirements.

**Our Approach**: We address these limitations through persistent memory systems and multi-modal feature fusion specifically designed for sports footage re-identification requirements.

## 2. Problem Definition and Methodology

### 2.1 Formal Problem Statement
**Input**: Video sequence V = {I₁, I₂, ..., Iₙ} of sports footage  
**Output**: Consistent player trajectories T = {T₁, T₂, ..., Tₘ} where each Tᵢ = {(bboxᵢⱼ, IDᵢ, tⱼ)} maintains the same IDᵢ across frames  

**Constraints**:
- Real-time processing requirement (>5 FPS)  
- Re-identification after temporary disappearance  
- Zero ID switching during continuous visibility  

### 2.2 System Architecture

Input Video → YOLOv11 Detection → Multi-Modal Features → Hungarian Assignment → Re-ID Memory → Output Tracks

#### Detection Module
- **YOLOv11 Model**: Fine-tuned for sports (4 classes: player, goalkeeper, referee, ball)  
- **Filtering**: Confidence threshold (0.5) with size/aspect ratio validation  
- **Performance**: 78ms inference time per frame  

#### Feature Extraction Pipeline
**Multi-modal feature combination**:  
F_combined = 0.6 × F_visual + 0.3 × F_color + 0.1 × F_spatial

- **F_visual**: ResNet18 features (512D) from multi-crop regions  
- **F_color**: HSV histogram focusing on jersey colors (100D)  
- **F_spatial**: Normalized position/size features (8D)  

#### Track Assignment Algorithm
**Hungarian Algorithm with Motion Gates**:  
S(d,t) = 0.2 × S_distance + 0.3 × S_IoU + 0.5 × S_feature  
If motion_distance > threshold → S(d,t) = 0.1  

#### Temporal Smoothing
**Exponential Moving Average**:  
F_smoothed = α × F_old + (1-α) × F_new, α = 0.7  
If cosine_similarity(F_old, F_new) < 0.3 → F_smoothed = F_old
