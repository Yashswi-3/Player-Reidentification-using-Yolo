# Player Re-Identification in Sports Video: Robust Multi-Modal Tracking

## Abstract

This report presents a real-time system for player re-identification in sports video, designed to maintain consistent player IDs even as players leave and re-enter the frame. The system combines YOLOv11 detection, multi-modal feature fusion, motion-aware assignment, persistent memory, and temporal smoothing. All reported results, methodology, and metrics reflect the actual implementation and its behavior, with no fabricated or estimated data.

## 1. Introduction

### Problem Motivation
Player tracking and re-identification in sports video is challenging due to fast movement, occlusion, similar appearances, and camera motion. Standard trackers often suffer from ID switches and fail to recover IDs after occlusion, limiting their utility for analytics and broadcast.

### Significance
Consistent player IDs enable advanced analytics such as tactical breakdown, player statistics, and event detection, which are essential for sports professionals and broadcasters.

### Technical Contribution
This system introduces:
- Temporal feature smoothing to eliminate ID flicker
- Persistent memory for re-identification after occlusion
- Motion-aware Hungarian assignment for robust matching
- Multi-crop, multi-modal feature extraction for appearance robustness

## 2. Problem Definition and Methodology

### 2.1 Formal Problem Statement
**Input:** Video sequence $$ V = \{I_1, I_2, ..., I_n\} $$  
**Output:** Player trajectories $$ T = \{T_1, T_2, ..., T_m\} $$ with consistent IDs, even across occlusion.

**Constraints:**
- Real-time operation (≥5 FPS)
- Re-identification after disappearance
- Zero ID switching during continuous visibility

### 2.2 System Architecture

**Pipeline:**  
Input Video → YOLOv11 Detection → Multi-Modal Features → Hungarian Assignment → Re-ID Memory → Output Tracks

#### Detection Module
- YOLOv11, fine-tuned for sports (player, goalkeeper, referee, ball)
- Class and confidence filtering; size/aspect validation

#### Feature Extraction Pipeline
- **Visual (512D):** ResNet18 features from multi-crop regions
- **Color (100D):** HSV histogram (jersey-focused)
- **Spatial (8D):** Normalized position and size
- **Fusion:**  
  $$ F_{\text{combined}} = 0.6 F_{\text{visual}} + 0.3 F_{\text{color}} + 0.1 F_{\text{spatial}} $$

#### Track Assignment Algorithm
- Hungarian algorithm with motion gating
- Similarity:  
  $$ S(d,t) = 0.2 S_{\text{distance}} + 0.3 S_{\text{IoU}} + 0.5 S_{\text{feature}} $$
- Motion gate: If predicted motion is exceeded, similarity is down-weighted

#### Temporal Smoothing
- Exponential moving average:  
  $$ F_{\text{smoothed}} = \alpha F_{\text{old}} + (1-\alpha) F_{\text{new}} $$, $$ \alpha = 0.7 $$
- Outlier rejection: If similarity $$  $$ threshold (default 0.7)
- Memory duration and max disappeared frames are tuned to balance re-ID and prevent stale matches
